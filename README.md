# derive.la
a mood board

created some time ago in undergrad, using html, css, javascript, json, lazyloading

influenced by jjjjound, reform.lt, and some other mood boards. has changed from a single long collection of images to multiple smaller collections of sub-moods.

when i have time, i'll add archive.derive.la
